# Installation

## Building from source

### Requirements

* go 1.14
* make
* gcc

### Binary

To get the binary and all plugins just run

```bash
make
```

and you'll get a `inetmock` binary and a `plugins` directory containing all default plugins.

The default plugins are:

* `http_mock`
* `dns_mock`
* `tls_interceptor`

## Docker/Podman

## Getting a pre-built binary (coming soon)
